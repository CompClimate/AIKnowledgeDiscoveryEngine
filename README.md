As the climate warms, finding pathways to resilience becomes increasingly pressing. Extreme
events, especially those where the atmosphere and ocean interact, such as marine heatwaves, atmospheric rivers
and hurricanes, are increasingly impacting society. Critically, our ability to understand
underlying mechanisms of current extremes and even geoengineering we may induce in the future
lags critically behind our capacity adapt to them. This is because despite decades of
observations and sophisticated Earth system models (ESM), the sheer complexity of these
systems has prevented us from distilling the fundamental physical relationships that govern
these events. Our work addresses a transformative question: Can interpretable machine
learning reveal the causal mechanisms underlying Earth system extremes, while simultaneously validating its
own discoveries in collaboration with scientists?
